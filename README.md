# CODE2040APIChallenge
API challenge for CODE2040
This is the coode for the CODE2040 API challenge.
I would like to describe the code as a learning experience. Doing the code in the first language that I learned which is Python really showed me how to apply the problem solving skills that I have been developing from the beginning into the challenge. Alike many other projects, it is important to understand what the challenge is requesting the participant to accomplish. After carefully reading the challenges, I did my research on using JSON with Python and I was able to register. As I progressed through the stages I felt prouder and prouder on the accomplishment which reminded me how much I like my career.
